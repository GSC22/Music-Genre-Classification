🎵 Music Genre Classification using Log-Mel Spectrograms

This project implements a Music Genre Classification system using Log-Mel Spectrogram features and Deep Learning. Audio files are converted into Log-Mel spectrogram images that capture time–frequency patterns aligned with human hearing perception. These spectrograms are then used to train a neural network model to accurately classify music into genres such as Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-hop, Jazz, and more.

The project demonstrates how raw audio signals can be transformed into meaningful visual representations and leveraged by machine learning models for audio understanding tasks.
